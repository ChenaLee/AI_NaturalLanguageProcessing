# CTCI ( Cracking The Coding Interview )
:Solutions of Cracking The Coding Interview Challenges on https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview.
Solutions and explanations are my own original work and unless otherwise noted, they passed all the test cases HackerRank provides.

All of the codes are written in python.

### Data Structures
01. Arrays: Left Rotation
02. Strings: Making Anagrams
03. Hash Tables: Ransom Note
04. Linked Lists: Detect a Cycle
05. Stacks: Balanced Brackets
06. Queues: A Tale of Two Stacks
07. Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?
08. Heaps: Find the Running Median
09. Tries: Contacts

### Algorithms
10. Sorting: Bubble Sort
11. Sorting: Comparator
12. Merge Sort: Counting Inversions
13. Binary Search: Ice Cream Parlor
14. DFS: Connected Cell in a Grid
15. BFS: Shortest Reach in a Graph

### Techniques / Concepts
16. Time Complexity: Primality
17. Recursion: Fibonacci Numbers
18. Recursion: Davis' Staircase
20. DP: Coin Change
21. Bit Manipulation: Lonely Integer
